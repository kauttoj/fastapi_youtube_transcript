# fastapi_youtube_transcript
This is a simple FastAPI app that provides youtube transcripts on request. It includes database handling to save and retrieve already processed files.

You should be able to dockerize this and deploy it in OpenShift out of the box. If you run it locally, change DB_PATH to your current working directory and follow any tutorials for running FastAPI with UVICORN.
